    <div>Holmes (in honor of John Holmes, the partner of Miss Linda Lovelace,
    the actress whose name was given to the Yale University project "Linda") is
    a distributed computing software project aiming to provide yet another fast?
    cluster-based shared memory illusion with particular emphasis on numerical
    computations of large (sparse or dense) matrices and vectors.
    
    The system architecture is rather simple, in that a dedicated set of data
    node processes acts as the (distributed) storage of the tuple-space, while
    another set of dictionary nodes acts as an LDAP lookup-and-forward service:
    the dictionary nodes know which server holds what keys, and thus are able
    to get the values of the lookup requests of their clients and return them to
    the clients. The dictionary nodes are also responsible for maintaining a 
    consistent state among themselves (thus guaranteeing that after a client
    "puts" a tuple in Holmes, a subsequent request arriving at any other dict
    node will be correctly honored; similarly, if a client requests removal of
    a tuple from Holmes, and it is honored, subsequent requests arriving at any
    other dict node will report that no such tuple exists -or will block until
    the tuple is put back in, depending on the semantics of the request.)
